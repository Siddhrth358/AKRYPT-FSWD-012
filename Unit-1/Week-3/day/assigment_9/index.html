        <p>Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). <br>
             At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve <br>
            communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the <br>
             Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle-from initial product  <br>
             conception through the actual product launch. <br> <br>
          I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering.  <br>
           My dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine,  <br>
           with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.

        At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore core class, <br>
         and Software Processes, a graduate seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor, <br>
         a freshmen orientation advisor, and served on leadership for campus chapters of both Habitat <br>
         for Humanity and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.
